AIM

Study and implementation of Python loops (for loop and nested loops) for number printing, matrix operations, combinations, and pattern generation.

For Loop : A for loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times. It iterates over a sequence such as a range of numbers.

Syntax: 
for variable in range(start, stop, step):
    statements

---

Nested Loop :

A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop. It is mainly used for:

* Matrix operations
* Pattern printing
* Generating combinations

## Programs and Algorithms

### 1. Print numbers from 1 to 5

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Use a for loop from 1 to 5
3. Print each number
4. Stop

---

### 2. Print even numbers from 2 to 10

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Use a for loop from 2 to 10 with step 2
3. Print each number
4. Stop

---

### 3. Add first n natural numbers

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Input value of n
3. Initialize sum = 0
4. Run loop from 1 to n
5. Add each number to sum
6. Print sum
7. Stop

---

### 4. Print a 3×3 matrix using nested loop

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Declare a 3×3 matrix
3. Use outer loop for rows
4. Use inner loop for columns
5. Print matrix elements
6. Stop

---

### 5. Print 3×3 matrix (alternate method)

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Declare matrix
3. Use loop to access each row
4. Print row
5. Stop

---

### 6. Multiplication of two 3×3 matrices

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Declare matrix A and matrix B
3. Initialize result matrix with zeros
4. Use three nested loops

   * First for rows
   * Second for columns
   * Third for multiplication and addition
5. Store multiplication result in result matrix
6. Print result matrix
7. Stop

---

### 7. Print all possible combinations of three digits

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Store three digits in a list
3. Use three nested loops
4. Check digits are not repeated
5. Print valid combinations
6. Stop

---

### 8. Right-angled triangle pattern

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Run loop for number of rows
3. Run inner loop to print stars
4. Move to next line after each row
5. Stop

---

### 9. Pyramid pattern

**Algorithm:**

1. Start
2. Set number of rows
3. Use loop from 1 to rows
4. Print spaces
5. Print stars
6. Move to next line
7. Stop
